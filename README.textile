h1=. Hyphenation for Go

p=. Version 1.0 -- 20 July 2010

p=. By "Jim Dovey":mailto:jimdovey@mac.com

h3. Requirements

* The "Go Trie package":http://github.com/AlanQuatermain/go-trie

h2. Introduction

This project implements a hyphenator which will take a block of text and hyphenate it according to some provided TeX-style rules. At present it doesn't interpret the TeX values verbatim, it expects them to be encoded a bit like Go source code, so I can use Go's Scanner class to parse it.

For more information on the TeX hyphenation algorithm, refer to the "original paper by Franklin Mark Liang":http://www.tug.org/docs/liang/liang-thesis.pdf.

h2. Installation

The simplest way to install is using goinstall:

> goinstall "github.com/AlanQuatermain/go-trie"
> goinstall "github.com/AlanQuatermain/go-hyphenator"

This will install the package in such a way that it must be imported using the above quoted string as its import statement, i.e. <code>import hyphenator "github.com/AlanQuatermain/go-hyphenator"</code>.

Alternatively you can clone the code directly and install it using <code>make install</code>. This will enable you to import it in your code using just <code>import "hyphenator"</code>.
